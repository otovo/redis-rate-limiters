--- Lua scripts are run atomically by default, and since redis
--- is single threaded, there are no race conditions to worry about.
---
--- This script does three things, in order:
--- 1. Retrieves token bucket state, which means the last slot assigned,
---    and how many tokens are left to be assigned for that slot
--- 2. Works out whether we need to move to the next slot, or consume another
---    token from the current one.
--- 3. Saves the token bucket state and returns the slot.
---
--- The token bucket implementation is forward looking, so we're really just handing
--- out the next time there would be tokens in the bucket, and letting the client
---
--- returns:
--- * The assigned slot, as a millisecond timestamp
